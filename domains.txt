This list of Internet top-level domains (TLD) contains top-level domains, which are those domains in the DNS root zone of the Domain Name System of the Internet. A list of the top-level domains by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is maintained at the Root Zone Database.[1] IANA also oversees the approval process for new proposed top-level domains for ICANN. As of April 2021, their root domain contains 1502 top-level domains.[2][3] As of March 2021, the IANA root database includes 1589 TLDs. That also includes 68 that are not assigned (revoked), 8 that are retired and 11 test domains.[1] Those are not represented in IANA's listing[2] and are not in root.zone file (root.zone file also includes one root domain).[4]

Main article: Top-level domain § Types
IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:[5]

infrastructure top-level domain (ARPA)
generic top-level domains (gTLD)
generic-restricted top-level domains (grTLD)
sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)
country code top-level domains (ccTLD)
test top-level domains (tTLD)
Original top-level domains
Seven generic top-level domains were created early in the development of the Internet, and predate the creation of ICANN in 1998.

Name: DNS names
Entity: intended use
Notes: general remarks
IDN: support for internationalized domain names (IDN)
DNSSEC: presence of DS records for Domain Name System Security Extensions
Name	Entity	Administrator[6]	Notes	IDN	DNSSEC	SLD	IPv6
.com	commercial	Verisign	This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register. Though originally intended for use by for-profit business entities, for a number of reasons it became the main TLD for domain names and is currently used by all types of entities including nonprofits, schools, and private individuals. Domain name registrations may be successfully challenged if the holder cannot prove an outside relation justifying reservation of the name,[7] to prevent "squatting". It was originally administered by the United States Department of Defense.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
.org	organization	Public Interest Registry	This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register. Originally intended for use by non-profit organizations, and still primarily used by some.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
.net	network	Verisign	This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register. Originally intended for use by domains pointing to a distributed network of computers, or "umbrella" sites that act as the portal to a set of smaller websites.	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
.int	international	Internet Assigned Numbers Authority	The .int TLD is strictly limited to organizations, offices, and programs endorsed by a treaty between two or more nations. However, a few grandfathered domains do not meet these criteria.	No	Yes	Yes	Yes
.edu	education	Educause (via Verisign)	The .edu TLD is limited to specific higher educational institutions such as, but not limited to, trade schools and universities. In the U.S., its use was restricted in 2001 to post-secondary institutions accredited by an agency on the list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies. This domain is therefore almost exclusively used by American colleges and universities. Some institutions, such as the Exploratorium, that do not meet the current registration criteria have grandfathered domain names.	No	Yes	Yes	Yes
.gov	U.S. national and state government agencies	Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (via Verisign)	The .gov TLD is limited to governmental entities and agencies as well as qualifying state, county and local municipal government agencies, and tribal governments.	No	Yes	Yes	Yes
.mil	U.S. military	United States Department of Defense	The .mil TLD is limited to divisions, services and agencies of the United States Department of Defense.	No	Yes	Yes	Yes
Infrastructure top-level domains
Infrastructure	Entity	Notes	IDN	DNSSEC
.arpa	"Address and Routing Parameter Area"	Originally assigned to the Advanced Research Projects Agency in the early days on the Internet, .arpa is now exclusively used as an Internet infrastructure TLD.	No	Yes
Country code top-level domains
Main article: Country code top level domain § Lists
As of 20 May 2017, there were 255 country-code top-level domains, purely in the Latin alphabet, using two-character codes. As of June 2022, the number was 316, with the addition of internationalized domains.[1]

Proposed internationalized ccTLDs

Special-Use Domains
ICANN/IANA has created some Special-Use domain names which are meant for special technical purposes. ICANN/IANA owns all of the Special-Use domain names.[226]

Name	Entity	Notes	IDN	DNSSEC
.example		Not installed as a domain name, but usable in text as an example.
(example.com, example.net, and example.org are also reserved for this purpose but are active sites.)	Un­known	
.invalid		Not installed as a domain name, but usable in testing as a domain which wouldn't work.	Un­known	
.local		Local network. Must be used with an mDNS server.[227]	Un­known	
.localhost		Points back to own computer.	Un­known	
.onion		Connection to the Tor network.	Un­known	
.test		Meant for testing DNS software.	Un­known	
Non-IANA domains
Besides the TLDs managed (or at least tracked) by IANA or ICANN, other independent groups have created, or had attempted to create, their own TLDs with varying technical specifications, functions, and outcomes.

Blockchain-registered
Blockchain-based domains are registered and exchanged using a public blockchain like Ethereum. Often times, these domains serve specific functions such as creating human-readable references to smart contract addresses used in DApps or personal wallet addresses.[228] Generally, these non-standard domains are unreachable through the normal DNS resolution process and instead require clients to use some sort of transparent web proxy or gateway to access them

Name	Blockchain	Notes
N/A	Handshake	Handshake is both an alternative DNS root zone and a domain name-centric blockchain meant for managing TLDs in a decentralized way which allows virtually any domain to be registered as a TLD by end users. The project intends to be a more resilient and distributed implementation of the global root zone without needing a centralized organization, like ICANN, to manage or operate it. Though it doesn't aim to outright replace the existing root zone, as it reserves all existing TLDs so that a query for wikipedia.org, for example, that is sent to a Handshake node can be redirected to the traditional root.[229]
.eth	Ethereum	Domains under the .eth TLD are primarily used as human-readable aliases to Ethereum wallet addresses, rather than IP addresses,[230] though some efforts into expanding the use of .eth into the traditional DNS space have been made.
.crypto, .zil	Ethereum, Zilliqa	Both .crypto and .zil aim to make cryptocurrency wallet address resolution easier, with the exception that, unlike the other examples mentioned here, the two TLDs are the product of a for-profit company, Unstoppable Domains, that markets the domains as an alternative DNS root despite being entirely dependent on the traditional root zone.[231]
.bit	Namecoin	Namecoin's .bit TLD technically operates as a single-domain DNS root, though has historically peered with the OpenNIC root zone to provide greater accessibility. The popularity and usage of .bit domains is much lower than the other projects mentioned, despite it being the earliest example. This is primarily due to the negative reputation Namecoin has garnered after .bit domains became popular for sharing and distributing illegal or illicit content such as malware, which ultimately prompted OpenNIC to end its peering agreement and stop serving the TLD in its root zone in 2018.[232]
Alternate roots
In the case of alternative DNS roots, organizations or projects make use of the same mechanisms of the DNS but instead take on the role of ICANN in managing and administering an entirely separate root zone, thus having the ability to create new TLDs independently. However, this doesn't make these domains any less isolated from the rest of the internet, though the ability for clients to resolve them theoretically only requires switching to a recursive DNS resolver that recognizes and serves records underneath the alternate root zone.
